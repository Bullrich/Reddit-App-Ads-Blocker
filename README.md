This small Firefox extension hides all the "use our app" promos and popups from Reddit's mobile site. It is intended for use with Firefox for Android.

Please note that this extension's mission is a moving target. When Reddit adds new app promos, it may take me a few days to add them to the block list.

In addition to hiding app promotions, this extension also hides the "Share" link that appears under every thumbnail (because I've only ever clicked those accidentally), shows the full comment thread instead of fading out after the first few comments, and removes the "top posts" from below the comment thread. In short, it aims to simplify the use of Reddit's mobile site and to remove barriers.

Forked from [Javier Bullrich's "No Reddit Mobile Ads" add-on](https://github.com/Bullrich/Reddit-App-Ads-Blocker), available under the MPL 2.0.
